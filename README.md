# Platform-Patrol
This project is being developed by following the tutorial series by Coding With Russ. Some game assets and base files are sourced from the tutorial repository and are used strictly for learning purposes. I am modifying and extending the project as I continue learning game development concepts.

It helped me understand core concepts such as game loops, player movement, collision detection, sprite handling, and level design.

While using the tutorial as a learning foundation, I am actively experimenting with the code and making modifications to it. I am also exploring additional features to strengthen my understanding of game logic and programming structure.
I plan to continue expanding it with new mechanics and improvements as I learn.
